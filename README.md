We propose a robust method for coherent vector field learning with outliers (mismatches) using manifold regularization, called manifold regularized coherent vector field (**MRCVF**). The method could remove outliers from inliers (correct matches) and learn coherent vector fields fitting for the inliers with graph Laplacian constraint.
